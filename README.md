# Reward Points System

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

- Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
- Make up a data set to best demonstrate the solution.
- Use React JS.
